    <h2>Calculate Monthly Salary from Annual Income</h2>
    <p>
      This monthly salary calculator helps you convert an annual salary into an estimated monthly income.
      By dividing yearly earnings into twelve equal parts, it provides a quick and clear view of monthly pay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many job offers and employment contracts list compensation annually, while personal expenses such as
      rent, utilities, and subscriptions are paid monthly. This calculator bridges that gap and makes income
      planning easier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you are budgeting, comparing job offers, or planning future expenses, converting annual salary
      into monthly income gives you better financial clarity. This tool is free to use and requires no sign-up.

    <h2>Monthly Salary Calculator FAQs</h2>

    <h3>How is monthly salary calculated from annual income?</h3>
    <p>
      Monthly salary is calculated by dividing your annual salary by 12, assuming income is spread evenly
      across all months of the year.
    </p>

    <h3>Does monthly salary include bonuses or commissions?</h3>
    <p>
      No. This calculator only converts base annual salary. Bonuses, commissions, and other variable income
      must be added manually to the annual amount if you want them included.
    </p>

    <h3>Is this monthly salary before or after taxes?</h3>
    <p>
      The result represents gross monthly salary before taxes and deductions. Your actual take-home pay may
      differ depending on tax rates and benefits.
    </p>

    <h3>What if I am paid monthly but not evenly each month?</h3>
    <p>
      If your monthly income varies, this tool provides an average monthly estimate based on total annual
      income rather than exact monthly payments.
