    <h2>How the Employer Cost Calculator Works</h2>

    <p>
      This employer cost calculator helps you estimate the true cost of employing a worker beyond their gross pay. As a free online tool, it allows employers, HR teams, and business owners to calculate total employee cost including payroll taxes, benefits, and additional expenses.
    </p>

    <p>
      To calculate employer cost, enter the employee’s gross pay and the employer payroll tax rate. In many countries, employers are required to pay additional payroll taxes such as social security contributions, unemployment insurance, or similar statutory charges.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can also include benefits costs such as health insurance, retirement contributions, or allowances. Other recurring employer expenses related to the employee, such as equipment, training, or administrative costs, can be added separately.
    </p>

    <p>
      Understanding the total employer cost is essential for workforce planning, budgeting, and hiring decisions. Many businesses underestimate the true cost of employment when only considering salary.
    </p>

    <p>
      This calculator is designed for small business owners, HR professionals, and finance teams who need a fast and reliable estimate. All calculations are performed locally in your browser for speed and privacy.
