      No. This calculator shows gross commission and total pay before taxes. Tax withholding varies by location and employment type and is not included in the calculation.
    </p>

    <h3>Can I include a base salary?</h3>
    <p>
      Yes. If your compensation plan includes a fixed base salary, you can enter it as an optional value. The calculator will add it to your commission to show total pay.

  <!-- Explanation -->
  <section class="tool-explanation">
    <h2>How the Commission Calculator Works</h2>

    <p>
      This commission calculator helps you estimate commission earnings based on your total sales amount and commission rate, without requiring spreadsheets or manual formulas.
    </p>

    <p>
      Enter the total value of sales you generated and the commission rate offered by your employer or contract. The calculator multiplies these values to determine your commission earned.
    </p>

    <p>
      If your compensation plan includes a base salary, you can include it as an optional input. The calculator adds the base salary to commission earnings to calculate total pay.
    </p>

    <p>
      Understanding commission income is important for budgeting, income forecasting, and evaluating sales performance, especially for commission-based roles.
    </p>

    <p>
      All calculations are performed locally in your browser to ensure fast results and protect your privacy.
