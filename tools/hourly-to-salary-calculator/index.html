    <h2>Hourly to Salary Calculator FAQs</h2>

    <h3>How does an hourly to salary calculator work?</h3>
    <p>
      The calculator multiplies your hourly wage by your weekly working hours and the number of weeks you work per year
      to estimate your annual salary.
    </p>

    <h3>What hours per week should I use?</h3>
    <p>
      If you work full-time, 40 hours per week is common. For part-time or variable schedules, use your average weekly
      hours for a more accurate result.
    </p>

    <h3>Should I include paid vacation or holidays?</h3>
    <p>
      If your employer pays you during vacations or holidays, you can include those weeks. If time off is unpaid,
      subtract those weeks from your yearly total.
    </p>

    <h3>Does this calculator include taxes or deductions?</h3>
    <p>
      No. This tool calculates gross annual salary only. Taxes, insurance, retirement contributions, and other
      deductions are not included.
