  <!-- Explanation -->
  <section class="tool-explanation">
    <h2>How the Biweekly Paycheck Calculator Works</h2>

    <p>
      This biweekly paycheck calculator helps you estimate how much you take home every two weeks based on your hourly wage, hours worked, overtime, and tax rates.
    </p>

    <p>
      Enter your hourly wage and total hours worked during the pay period. If you worked overtime, include those hours separately. A biweekly pay schedule typically results in 26 paychecks per year.
    </p>

    <p>
      The calculator first determines your gross pay, then estimates taxes using the federal and state percentages you provide. These amounts are subtracted to calculate your net pay.
    </p>

    <p>
      Understanding your biweekly net pay helps with budgeting recurring expenses such as rent, utilities, loan payments, and savings contributions.
    </p>

    <p>
      All calculations are performed locally in your browser for speed and privacy, and inputs can be adjusted at any time for instant results.
