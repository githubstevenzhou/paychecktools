<h1>Gross vs Net Income: What’s the Difference?</h1>

<p>Understanding the difference between gross income and net income is essential when evaluating your paycheck.</p>

<h2>What Is Gross Income?</h2>
<p>Gross income is the total amount you earn before any taxes or deductions. This includes salary, hourly wages, bonuses, and commissions.</p>

<h2>What Is Net Income?</h2>
<p>Net income is the amount you take home after taxes and deductions are subtracted from your gross income.</p>

<h2>Why the Difference Matters</h2>
<p>Job offers are usually quoted in gross income, but your actual spending power depends on net income.</p>
